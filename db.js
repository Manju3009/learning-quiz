After removing 10L and adding 10L water: milk = 7x/10 - 7/10 x 10 = 7x/10 - 7. Water = 3x/10 - 3 + 10 = 3x/10 + 7. Ratio: (7x/10 - 7)/(3x/10 + 7) = 3/2. 14x/10 - 14 = 9x/10 + 21. 5x/10 = 35. x = 70. Rechecking with x=50: milk = 35, after = 35-7=28. Water = 15-3+10=22. Ratio 28:22 = 14:11 ≠ 3:2. With x=70: milk=49, after=49-7=42. Water=21-3+10=28. Ratio 42:28=3:2. So answer is 70 liters.'},
